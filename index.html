    <h2>Just some stuff</h2>
    
    <p>My name is Mariah Shanks, and I am 30 years old. Come the start of the Fall semester I will have been back in school for about a year now. Currently I am working as a sales associate for Ross Dress for Less part time, so balancing school and work tends to be a bit stressful. Despite this, I'd like to think I've managed a fairly healthy balance and have learned quite a bit in my journey. Ultimately, I'm hoping to be able to apply these new skills to a better job that I'll love.</p>

        <li>Playing the critically acclaimed MMO Final Fantasy XIV.</li>
        <li>Hitting the YouTube rabbit hole just to see what strange videos I can find (currently discovered the world of Lego stop motion).</li>

    <p>Currently I am rather addicted to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a>.</p>

    <h2>Or How Temperatures Are Not The Same</h2>
        <p><small>So, back during my junior year of high school at La Serna, I was in AP Chemistry. It was toward the end of the school year, we had just gotten over the AP exams (which yours truly did not do well on…) and the teacher thought, hey, why don’t we make soap as one big wind down?</small></p>
        <p><small>Of course, being teenagers this is clearly an amazing idea that has absolutely no downsides whatsoever.</small></p>
        <p><small>We’re all doing our thing split into groups, and us all being AP students the teacher assumes we all know the difference between Celsius and Fahrenheit by now. Apparently not, because one group just assumed that 90 degrees Fahrenheit would be the same as 90 degrees Celsius and thought it smart to just dump their lye into a concoction that was boiling at a whopping <b>194 degrees Fahrenheit</b>.</small></p>
        <p><small>Of course, the fire alarms were soon going off and the whole school ended up having to be evacuated while poison control was called in to safely dispose of a hot plate that was completely caked with the burnt mixture of vegetable oil, pure lye, and water.</small></p>
        <p><small>And that’s the story of how my AP chemistry class nearly burnt down the science wing of my high school and required actual hazmat complete poison control to come in and give the clear.</small></p>
